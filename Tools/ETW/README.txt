To sync up VS you go to the 'source code' tab and 'Connect' link in the banner.
It will show you connection instructions.  You must be a member of the project to connect with VS

Sync the TOOLS\ETW directory

In TOOLS\ETW you will find preparePerfMonitor.bat file.  This will create a 'Upload' directory 
that has the ZIP files you want to make for a distribution.
