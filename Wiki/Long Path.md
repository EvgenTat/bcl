## Long Path
The long path wrapper provides functionality to make it easier to work with paths that are longer than the current 259 character limit of the System.IO namespace. Using the long path classes, projects can now use paths up to 32,000 characters.

For more information on why .NET currently lacks built-in support for long paths, see the following blog post on the BCL blog:
